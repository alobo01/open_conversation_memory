- Requires coordination with API team for integration

#### Workstream B: Testing Infrastructure (24 hours/week)
- Focus on TEST-001, TEST-002
- Can work in parallel with feature development
- Requires access to completed features for E2E testing

#### Workstream C: Memory & Retrieval (16 hours/week)
- Focus on MEM-003, MEM-004
- Can work independently of frontend
- Requires coordination with KG team

#### Workstream D: Infrastructure & Deployment (16 hours/week)
- Focus on DOCKER-001, DOCKER-002, KG-005
- Can work independently of feature development
- Critical path for production deployment

## Dependency Management

### Critical Dependencies
1. **UI-003** depends on **ASR-003** ✅ (completed)
2. **MEM-003** depends on **KG-004** ✅ (completed)
3. **MEM-004** depends on **MEM-003**
4. **TEST-003** depends on **UI-003** and **MEM-003**
5. **DOCKER-003** depends on all service completions

### Parallel Execution Matrix

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Ready
- [ ] Task has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and resolved
- [ ] Required environment is set up
- [ ] Test cases are defined

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review passed

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Audio Recording Integration (UI-003)**: WebRTC complexity across browsers
2. **Memory Extraction Pipeline (MEM-003)**: LLM extraction accuracy
3. **E2E Testing (TEST-003)**: Complex multi-service integration
4. **Offline Deployment (DOCKER-003)**: Model management and dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Early Prototyping**: Build quick proofs of concept for high-risk items
2. **Parallel Testing**: Test components in isolation before integration
3. **Incremental Integration**: Integrate components gradually
4. **Fallback Planning**: Have backup solutions for critical components
