# EmoRobCare Test Failure Analysis - Task Continuation

## Current Status
I was systematically fixing EmoRobCare test failures to achieve 95%+ test pass rate. The system is a conversational AI for children with TEA2 (autism spectrum disorder).

## Completed Work âœ…
- **Memory Service**: Fixed Qdrant initialization issues - ALL 19 TESTS NOW PASSING
- Fixed mock configuration, collection creation logic, and service initialization

## Next Priority: LLM Service Template Responses
Need to examine and fix failing template response tests in:
- `tests/unit/test_llm_service.py::TestTemplateResponses`
- Missing methods: `get_template_response_school()` and `get_template_response_family()`
- Age-appropriate responses for levels 1-5 (Spanish-first)

## Remaining Priorities (in order)
1. **LLM Service** - Template responses (HIGH)
2. **Knowledge Graph Router** - SPARQL queries, triple insertion (HIGH)  
3. **Emotion Service** - Edge cases in conversation analysis (MEDIUM)
4. **Safety Service** - Missing 'detection_rules_count' attribute (LOW)

## Goal
Fix all failing tests to achieve 95%+ success rate across 195 total tests, ensuring TEA2 children functionality with safety measures, emotion detection, and knowledge graph capabilities.

## Next Steps
1. Run LLM service tests to identify specific failures
2. Implement missing template response methods
3. Ensure age-appropriate, Spanish-first responses
4. Continue with remaining services
5. Final verification of all 195 tests

Continue from where I left off with the LLM service template response fixes.
