## Mock Strategy

All tests use comprehensive mocking to isolate components:

### 🔌 Mocked Dependencies
- **Database**: MongoDB operations mocked
- **External Services**: LLM, ASR, SPARQL endpoints mocked
- **Network Calls**: HTTP requests mocked
- **File System**: Audio files and temporary storage mocked

### 🎯 Isolation Benefits
- Tests run independently without external dependencies
- Fast execution without real service calls
- Consistent test environment
- Edge cases easily simulated

## Test Execution

### 🚀 Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
python -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v
